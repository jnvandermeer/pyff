The Features of Pyff, or Why Is It Important?
---------------------------------------------

The idea is to use free, open-sourced, software-license free programs to perform Neurofeedback experiments. In the python world, only psychopy (optimizing for stimulus generation, timing in sofar possible, logging) and pyff (solving the problem of real-time update of stimuli and experiments depending on experimental data) are available. They also offer core functionality that supplements each other.

| Psychopy | Pyff |
|----------|------|
| start/stop experiments | visual stimuli |
| remote control | auditory stimuli |
| send data to experiment | logging |
| |use the extra screen |


Together, they provide the ideal solution for stimulus presentation and real-time adaptation of visual and auditory stimuli.

A typical workflow exists of, when it comes to stimulus computer:

1. Start up the lab's specific Stimulus computer
2. Double-click the icon to start up FeedbackController
3. WHEN DOING RT: Use your real-time fMRI computer to send signals to the Stimulus computer via TCP/IP to start/stop any (pre-built) experiment and send signals to the (running) NF Experiment
4. NOT DOING RT: Use the Stimulus or the RT Computer computer to start/stop a non-RT Experiment



Installation
------------

The Pyff + Psychopy should not be installed 'like that' on your system. It is highly recommended to use a conda environment for that, otherwise chances are high things won't run. This is not just true for this Python package, but true for ALL Python packages in which some development is going on. The main reason is that Pyff is a rather old package, so won't work with the most up-to-date version of pyqt. Also it is coded in Python = 2.7, and it'd take serious effort to try to convert to python = 3.5. In addition, Psychopy is (as of yet) coded in python 2.7. The use of a conda environment guarantees that the packages will run as intended on any system. In addition, it's rather easy to make a shortcut to start things up.

The way to install this stimulus presentation is:

1. Install Git
2. Install Conda
3. Grab Repository of Pyff (using Git)
4. Use Conda to set up the correct environment
5. Make the shortcut to easily quick-start the FeedbackController

```console
$ git clone github.com/jnvandermeer/pyff
$ cd pyff
```

Then, once inside, use conda to install the environment, including psychopy!

```console
$ conda install environment.xml
```


Psychopy
--------

Some words on Psychopy: Psychopy has been integrated as a FeedbackBase class, located in /src/FeedbackBase, which does all of the initialization stuff. Psychopy uses (and should work) with Pyglet, so we can solve the issue of multiple screens.

How to use the FeedbackController
=================================

Enter the src directory and start FeedbackController:

    cd src
    python FeedbackController.py


If you made changes to the gui.ui or just checked out the tree from SVN, you
may have to rebuild the gui.py:

    cd src
    make

How to use the parallel port under linux
========================================

```bash
$ sudo modprobe -r lp
$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/parport0
```
